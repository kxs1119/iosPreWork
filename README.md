App Idea
  My dream application that I would like to create would be used not only on IOS, but also Mac. This application will be integrated with AI and will have a target audience of High School seniors and 
  college students to give the best financial advise from their device. This app will also have apperance customization to different backgrounds, live photos, different font styles, etc.
